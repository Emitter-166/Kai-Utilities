step one, find the reason.
    compare error with the working ones, get as much infos as possible

    if I aready typed in a channel then try to access leaderboard, it works fine
    but when I do it for an empty channel, nothing hape

    in a healthy case, channels and message amounts are added normally, and we can access it .
    issue one: channels are getting added together instead of a space note: only the first one is being seperated, other ones are like smashed together
    when I write in the channel, it gets added by a whitespace.
    update: the values are getting attached when messages are send


    issue two: channel is not getting created in database, a seperate field in document is suppose be created in server settings document

    update: it's fixed

    first issue was happening because we were using keys as values at one point and didn't add a space there, simple
    second issue was happening cause when it tries to check if that value was there before, it got null pointer exception because it's new


    issues needs to be fixed again: where there is no whitespace in users. (solved)


    next thing to do:

    auto drawer from messages, they can set the duration, amount of smiles and amount of winners, and if the winners will be selected by most typed or random one
    there will be a way to increase percentages of their chance to win


    and ofc, there is bugs in leaderboard. time to debug (fixed)

    next things to get done:
        make smile giver simpler and removing manual give with a special feature (done)
        fix .messages command (done)
        add auto picker feature no need

    (7/12/2022)
    truth and dare bot:
            step one find a free truth and dare api
            if can't, do web scraping and get a bunch of questions
            whenever someone uses .truth they will get a truth or dare question
            we can add questions by .truthAdd questionString
            (not yet done)

    wish work reminder:
            make it so that every 20 messages there will be a bot ad
            make it so only kai bear silvers can use that feature otherwise it will show an error
            (done)

    20-80 percent statistics:
    find out which percent of the users makes up most of the engagements
    it will store the amount of messages there is in one week, in total and for individual users.
    also there will be a user count of how many people have talked in one week.
    .stats command will show what percentage of user talks and what percentage from that
    makes up most of the engagement, total amount of messages that week, average messages per user, amount of users.

    basically calculate how many percentages of the user is generating 80 percent of the results

    database variables:
        server:
            users:
            total amount of users who talked: (totalUsers)
            messages:
            role to mention:
            channel to send report to:

        user:
            total messages this week:


        calculation process:
            step1: divide messages by users and get average messages per users
            step2:



        embed will look like this:
            80% messages sent by:
            Total amount of messages this week:
            Average amount of messages



    things to complete: (4:37 pm, 7/15/2022)
    make a thread that will create a image with xchart and will upload it when calculate cmd is used
    make a thread that can clear every data
    make a way that will send summary every end of the week and will clear datas
    make a way to set role to mention and summary channel

    bugs to fix tmorrow:
    fix sync uses on calculate with response
    add some more details

    find out how countdown latch sync was working on the last one. (done)

    fix issue where database isn't being updated.
    fix issue with displaying date
    fix issue with sending summaries
    make it so that there will be no totalMessages and it will be taken directly from the users

  event monitor stats will show:

  amount of users
  total messages
  average messages by users
  duration of that event
  average messages per minutes
