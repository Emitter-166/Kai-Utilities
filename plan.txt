step one, find the reason.
    compare error with the working ones, get as much infos as possible

    if I aready typed in a channel then try to access leaderboard, it works fine
    but when I do it for an empty channel, nothing hape

    in a healthy case, channels and message amounts are added normally, and we can access it .
    issue one: channels are getting added together instead of a space note: only the first one is being seperated, other ones are like smashed together
    when I write in the channel, it gets added by a whitespace.
    update: the values are getting attached when messages are send


    issue two: channel is not getting created in database, a seperate field in document is suppose be created in server settings document

    update: it's fixed

    first issue was happening because we were using keys as values at one point and didn't add a space there, simple
    second issue was happening cause when it tries to check if that value was there before, it got null pointer exception because it's new


    issues needs to be fixed again: where there is no whitespace in users. (solved)


    next thing to do:

    auto drawer from messages, they can set the duration, amount of smiles and amount of winners, and if the winners will be selected by most typed or random one
    there will be a way to increase percentages of their chance to win


    and ofc, there is bugs in leaderboard. time to debug (fixed)

    next things to get done:
        make smile giver simpler and removing manual give with a special feature (done)
        fix .messages command (done)
        add auto picker feature
